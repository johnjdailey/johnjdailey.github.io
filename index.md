## Welcome to GitHub Pages
Born on a Monday, my parents later thought I was mentally retarded because I couldn't walk, then one day I stood up and ran.

My first programming experience was at age 8, when I programmed various Lego Mindstorm robots, after I sold beanie babies in the newspaper.

In college while studying Geography I enjoyed using GIS to project different datasets as maps. My independent study was used for a publication.

Learning Java wasn't interesting to me past "Hello World" and "Build a Calculator" so I later chose to play with making fake internet money
writing smart contracts on the Ethereum network in Solidity and minting tokens. These days I practice Python. Looking forward to C.

You're awesome for reading my portoflio Homepage. I hope that all of your projects are going well, and that you have plans to accomplish all
of your dreams in life.

It's exciting to dream, make plans, build things, grind head down, learn, and keep working. Quantitative Analysis, automation, machine learning,
and aritifial intelligence excite me. At night, when all is quiet, I prefer to code and learn than to sleep. When I do sleep, I dream of code,
and look forward to the night when I also solve problems in my dreams.

Learning to code has been one of the most exciting journeys in my life. I'm commited to a marathon, not a sprint, or perhaps several sprints,
with celebrations along the way, to stay agile on the road to success. I hate not knowing everything about computers, and that embarasses me.
Shame and curiosity produces the will to overcome. Learning Python SQL, R and C are my priority languages while Java, Javascript, PHP, Rust, and HTML also intrest me.
Failure is not a stranger to me, but I overcome with antifragility. Failure is not the objective, but I embrace the lessons to learn, and try again.

Inspiration comes from the greats, like Guido Van Rossum, Elon Musk, Charles Flint, and Nikola Tesla. Wonder, what will you be remembered for?
What is your legacy? I'm pursuing mine. Life is short, grasp it, cherish it, and love your fellow man. Do what you love. This time we are living 
in is like none other, we can do our best to enjoy it, while also creating a better future for mankind. I like to do yoga in the morning,
break my intermittent fast, catch up on Data Science topics in the online community, read to learn and practice new concepts, try to build things,
go on a bike ride every weekday, exercise with my own body weight, and try to follow a keto diet one month, while a blue zone diet the next. I
want to be a better programmer everyday, add value to the lives others with data science, and promote world peace.
